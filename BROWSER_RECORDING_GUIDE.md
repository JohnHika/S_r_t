## 🔧 Troubleshooting Browser Recording

### **No Microphone Access?**
- **Check browser permissions**: Look for a microphone icon in the address bar
- **Enable microphone**: Click the icon and select "Allow"
- **Try different browser**: Chrome and Firefox work best
- **Check system settings**: Ensure microphone is not muted

### **Recording Not Working?**
- **Refresh the page** and try again
- **Check microphone connection** (if using external mic)
- **Test microphone** in other apps first
- **Clear browser cache** if issues persist

### **Poor Audio Quality?**
- **Speak closer** to the microphone
- **Reduce background noise** (close windows, turn off fans)
- **Use headset** for better audio isolation
- **Check microphone settings** in system preferences

### **Can't Hear Playback?**
- The app doesn't play back recordings (privacy feature)
- Audio is processed directly for transcription
- Use file upload if you need to hear the audio first
