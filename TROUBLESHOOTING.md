# üîß Troubleshooting Browser Recording

## Common Issues and Solutions

### ‚ùå **Error: "navigator.mediaDevices is undefined"**

**Problem:** Browser recording requires HTTPS (secure connection)

**Solutions:**

#### **Option 1: Use HTTPS (Recommended)**
```bash
# Stop current app
pkill -f streamlit

# Start with HTTPS
./start_web_app.sh
# Choose option 2 when prompted

# Visit: https://localhost:8501
# Accept certificate warning when prompted
```

#### **Option 2: Chrome with Insecure Localhost**
```bash
# Start Chrome with special flag
google-chrome --unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure=http://localhost:8501 --user-data-dir=/tmp/chrome_dev_test
```

#### **Option 3: Use File Upload Instead**
- Record audio with your phone or computer
- Save as WAV file
- Upload via "üìÅ Upload File" tab
- Works without HTTPS!
